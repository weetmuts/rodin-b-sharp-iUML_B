    delivering, extending, and upgrading the Content.  Typical modules\n\
    may include plug-ins ("Plug-ins"), plug-in fragments\n\
    ("Fragments"), and features ("Features").\n\
  - Each Plug-in or Fragment may be packaged as a sub-directory or JAR\n\
    (Java(TM) ARchive) in a directory named "plugins".\n\
  - A Feature is a bundle of one or more Plug-ins and/or Fragments and\n\
    associated material.  Each Feature may be packaged as a\n\
    sub-directory in a directory named "features".  Within a Feature,\n\
    files named "feature.xml" may contain a list of the names and\n\
    version numbers of the Plug-ins and/or Fragments associated with\n\
    that Feature.\n\
  - Features may also include other Features ("Included\n\
    Features"). Within a Feature, files named "feature.xml" may\n\
    contain a list of the names and version numbers of Included\n\
    Features.\n\
\n\
The terms and conditions governing Plug-ins and Fragments should be\n\
contained in files named "about.html" ("Abouts"). The terms and\n\
conditions governing Features and Included Features should be\n\
contained in files named "license.html" ("Feature Licenses").  Abouts\n\
and Feature Licenses may be located in any directory of a Download or\n\
Module including, but not limited to the following locations:\n\
\n\
  - The top-level (root) directory\n\
  - Plug-in and Fragment directories\n\
  - Inside Plug-ins and Fragments packaged as JARs\n\
  - Sub-directories of the directory named "src" of certain Plug-ins\n\
  - Feature directories\n\
\n\
Note: if a Feature made available by the Rodin Project is installed\n\
using the Eclipse Update Manager, you must agree to a license\n\
("Feature Update License") during the installation process.  If the\n\
Feature contains Included Features, the Feature Update License should\n\
either provide you with the terms and conditions governing the\n\
Included Features or inform you where you can locate them.  Feature\n\
Update Licenses may be found in the "license" property of files named\n\
"feature.properties" found within a Feature.  Such Abouts, Feature\n\
Licenses, and Feature Update Licenses contain the terms and conditions\n\
(or references to such terms and conditions) that govern your use of\n\
the associated Content in that directory.\n\
