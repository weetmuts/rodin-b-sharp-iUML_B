	/**
	 * A Descriptor for generated model changes. 
	 * The feature of the parent will be changed in the following ways:
	 * 
	 * 	If remove is false:
	 * 1) If the feature is a containment and the value is an element of the correct kind, the 
	 *    value will be added to the containment in a position according to the priority
	 * 2) If the feature is a reference and the value is an element of the correct kind, the 
	 *    value will be added to the reference in a position according to the priority
	 * 3) If the feature is an EAttribute and the value is of the correct type, the 
	 *    feature will be set to the value
	 *    
	 *    priority can be used to control the relative position of the generated elements  
	 *    1 - must come first
	 *    10 - not important
	 *    ---user entered items---
	 *    0 must come after user entered items
	 *    -10 must come last
	 *    
	 *    editable - this affects read-only status of the generated element and whether or not it will be
	 *    preserved or re-generated in a subsequent generation.
	 *    	false - the element is set as read-only (the user cannot change its attributes nor add/remove children),
	 *    			any existing copy of the element will be deleted and re-generated at each re-generation
	 *    	true  - the element is not read-only and will not be deleted before re-generation. 
	 *    			(N.B It is the responsibility of the client rules to check whether this element already exists and 
	 *    				only only generate a new one if it does not)
	 *    
	 *  If remove is true:
	 * 1) If the feature is a containment and the value is an element of the correct kind, the 
	 *    value will be deleted from the containment
	 * 2) If the feature is a reference and the value is an element of the correct kind, the 
	 *    value will be removed from the reference
	 * 3) If the feature is an EAttribute, the 
	 *    feature will be unset
